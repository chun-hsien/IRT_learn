## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r difR}
library("hemp")
library("difR")
VerbAgg <- VerbAggWide[, c(3, 4:27)]
```
show results of difMH
```{r difR}
results_MH <- difMH(Data = VerbAgg, group = "Gender", focal.name = "F")
results_MH
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
